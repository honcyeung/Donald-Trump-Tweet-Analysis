# Donald Trump Tweet Analysis

This project analyzes the tweets of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States using python. I would like to study his topics of interests, common positive and negative words, tags, and hashtags.

                                                                                                                         </p>
The txt documents already contain a lot of Trump's tweets. The dataset of positive words, negative words, and stop words will be used for later coding.
